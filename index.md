## Welcome

Haoran Tang is a second-year PhD student at Purdue CS, advised by Prof. [Rajiv Khanna](https://rjvak7.github.io/). He received his MSE in Robotics from University of Pennsylvania and BS in Computer Engineering from University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Haoran was born and raised in Chongqing, China, a metropolis built on mountains and rivers.

## Research Interests

Haoran's current research focuses on faithful Machine Unlearning beyond prediction suppression, separating forgotten concepts in the representation space and unlearning in an orthogonal subspace that does not impact retained knowledge. Other interests with past experience include Contrastive Learning and Diffusion Models.
